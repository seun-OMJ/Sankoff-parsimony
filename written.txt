1. The cost calculation step can be modified by adding check (an if statement) 
such that if the current pair of being checked is among the inter-dependent ones, 
use the function, F(nucleo1, nucleo2), then add this cost to the value in the cost matrix for that pair

2. Yes, it is possible. for each nucleotide, we will compare with all child nodes of its parent. 
A new score matrix will be constructed such that we have every possible combination of sequence 
scores down(ie. if there were n child nodes per parent, there will be an n-dimennsional matrix)
